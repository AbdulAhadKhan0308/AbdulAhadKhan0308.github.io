<h2>About</h2>
<p> Hello there! I am Abdul Ahad Khan from Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, I am enrolled as a BTech
student majoring in Information Technology. I am currently a second year student thus I still
have a lot to learn. As the pace of advancement in Technology continues to grow, I try to 
be inquisitive, curious and challenge myself to try to solve modern problems  using computer technologies.

Computers, smartphones and the Internet have played a huge role in our lives. New experiences, ideas and information have
been able to inspire, educate and change peoples' lives through these technologies. It has given people new modes of employment and entertainment. I have always had
a strange fascination for the Internet, whether it was talking to people across international waters, or competing in coding contests
with anyone across the world. Such experiences would not have been possible without the Internet. This is why I want to continue to learn and work in this field .</p>
